# Python Built-in Functions

A comprehensive guide to Python's powerful built-in functions that enhance productivity and code quality without requiring additional imports.

## What Are Built-in Functions?

Python's built-in functions are ready-to-use tools available in any Python environment. These functions offer capabilities across multiple domains:

- Type conversion (int, float, str)
- Mathematical calculations (abs, sum, max)
- Collection manipulation (sorted, map, filter)
- I/O operations (print, input)
- Object inspection (type, dir, help)
- And many more essential utilities!
